# Fish School

MATLAB Simulation of Fish Schooling Behavior

Written to explore the structure and behavior of fish schools via a computer simulation. Investigates parameters such as school size, form, density, speed, and nearest-neighbor distance between individuals. Demonstrates some of the basic principles of self-organization, a phenomenon in nature that leads to complex structures and behaviors based on a set of simple rules.
