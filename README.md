Objectives:

- Explore the structure and behavior of fish schools via a computer simulation.
- Investigate parameters such as school size, form, density, speed, and nearest-neighbor distance between individuals.
- Demonstrate some of the basic principles of self-organization, a phenomenon in nature that leads to complex structures and behaviors based on a set of simple rules.
